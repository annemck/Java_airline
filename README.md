# Java Airline

A CodeClan homework for testing the essentials of Java learned in week 11. This was to model an online travel booking company.

The following assumptions were made during the creation of this homework:

* Each passenger bag weighs the same
* Planes reserve half of their total weight for passenger bags
* The weight of bag per person is the weight reserved for passenger bags divided by the capacity
* Passengers exist for a single flight only
